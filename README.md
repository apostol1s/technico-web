# technico-web

## Overview

This is the second phase of the Technico project.The goal of this phase was to transform the existing application into a web-based system using Jakarta EE technologies.  The application now includes a set of RESTful Web Services enabling external systems and clients to interact with the application's core functionality via HTTP, receiving and sending data in JSON format.
